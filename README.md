# Thesis
# An Investigation of Multivariate Patterns Differentiating Rural and Urban Fatal U.S. Motor Vehicle Accidents

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to investigate multivariate importance of variables selected into patterns that can significantly differentiate fatal U.S. motor vehicle accidents between urban and rural locations.  It is important to understand these differences to improve rural outcomes.  Although rural areas only account for 19% of the population, they account for 46% of fatal accidents.
